# Traffic Monitoring Application for RYU    
Traffic monitoring application is implementations of aSTEAM Project https://asteam.korea.ac.kr. 
Application that uses OpenFlow to obtain statistical information of the switch. A source code for adding a variety of statistical features from the simple monitor application of the RYU, which stores the collected data in a txt file.  
## Requirements  
For execution, OpenFlow switches use Mininet as an Open vSwitch execution environment.  
- Mininet  
- Open vSwitch  
- Ryu  
`$ sudo apt-get install git python-dev python-setuptools python-pip`  
`$ git clone https://github.com/osrg/ryu.git`  
`$ cd ryu`  
`$ sudo pip install .`  
## Running  
1. Set topology  
The deployment environment is a simple configuration of three hosts, one switch.  
`$ sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote -x`  
When executed, five xterms are started. Each xterm corresponds to a host 1-3, switch, and controller.  

2. Check the status of the Open vSwitch.  
It is xterm for switches with the title 「switch : s1 (root)」.   
**switch: s1:**  
`root@ryu-vm:~# ovs-vsctl show`  
`root@ryu-vm:~# ovs-dpctl show`  
Make sure that switch (bridge) s1 is created and that the host has three additional corresponding ports.  

3. Set the OpenFlow version to 1.3.  
Set the OpenFlow version by running the command in xterm for the switch.  
**switch: s1:**  
`root@ryu-vm:~# ovs-vsctl set Bridge s1 protocols=OpenFlow13`  

4. Check the flow table.  
**switch: s1:**  
`root@ryu-vm:~# ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 dump-flows s1`  
When executing the 'ovs-ofctl' command, you must specify the version of OpenFlow. The default is OpenFlow10.  

5. Run the traffic monitor.  
Run the following command in xterm with the window title「controller : c0 (root)」.  
**controller: c0:**  
`root@ryu-vm:~# ryu-manager --verbose ./traffic_monitor.py`  
There are no flow entries, and the number of each port is also zero.  

6. Ping host1 to host2.  
**host: h1:**  
`root@ryu-vm:~# ping -c1 10.0.0.2`  
Packet transmission and flow entries are registered and statistical information is changed.  

7. Statistical information such as flows and ports can be found in xterm with the window title 「controller : c0 (root)」.
